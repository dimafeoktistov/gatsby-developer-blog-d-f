# Tomsk map

This project is last project of Udacity FEND.

I created this project as my f–≥rst steps of studying React.js. It's a simple front-end
web application that uses Google Maps API to render list of POI's at Tomsk city. The information
for the places was provided by [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/places-api).

This project is bootstraped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Features

The content is responsive. The project uses axios to handle interactions with third party API's.
I handle asynchronous errors with ErrorBoundry component and catch functions in promises. User can filter
lList of places by their name.

## Setting up development

Clone the project and install all dependencies with npm or yarn

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dimafeoktistov/udacity-neibourhood-map.git
cd udacity-neibourhood-map
npm i
```

When you finish the installation, you can run `npm start` and navigate to `localhost:3000`.

## Making production build

Use this in case you don't want to check out [live](https://udacity-neibourhood-map.firebaseapp.com) version of web-app and you want to check offline app behavior, because service worker is off in development build, see all changes in real-time.

To make a production build run `npm run build` and then `serve -s build`.
